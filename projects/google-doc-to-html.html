			<h1>DFTW Google Doc Challenge</h1>

			<p>The purpose of this document is to test my google doc skills. I’d rate myself at a 1/10 with word 
			processors so I have 40 minutes to complete the challenge. Let’s see how this goes.</p>

			<h2>My favorite place</h2>

			<p>My favorite place is Alepochori, located in Athens, Greece. I like this place because this is where 
			I spent all my summers growing up in the company of my grandparents. There were not a whole bunch 
			of activities to do there but I got to spend a lot of time with friends, playing games and exploring 
			the place. It’s located by the sea so we got the chance to go fishing and simply sunbathe by the beach.</p>

			<p>Three of my favorite things about this place would be:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The beach near my house</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>The mountains surrounding Alepochori</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>The beautiful sunset</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Greek food</h2>
			<p>Greek cuisine is well known as being part of the mediterranean diet which is renowned as being one 
			of the healthier diets out there.</p>

			<h3>MOUSAKAS</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Bolognese sauce</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>Bechamel sauce</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>Aubergines</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>STRAPATSADA</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Eggs</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>Tomatoes</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>Feta cheese</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>TRIPE SOUP</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Cow leg</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>Cow stomach</li>

				<li style='margin-top: 20px;'>Garlic</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>This is the concluding paragraph</h2>

			<p>I’m not sure this is what one would call a coherent document, it’s a bit all over the place. 
			I talked about the purpose of this document, my favorite place as well as some of my favorite Greek foods. 
			About 19 minutes have elapsed thus far.</p>

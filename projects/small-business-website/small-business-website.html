				<h1>Who we are</h1>
				<p>We are a new cleaning services startup specializing in high-end housekeeping. Our personalized approach to house cleaning along with our trusted team of dedicated professionals will ensure your house gets and stays clean!</p>
				<h2>What makes us different</h2>
				<p>You get a couple of initial home visits from Joy, our head of the company, to prioritize your space, get rid of what’s not important, and finally create an organizational system that the house cleaners will then implement and follow. Joy also makes surprise visits to her clients' homes in order to maintain the aesthetics she has created and to personally train new house cleaners.</p>
				<h2>Services</h2>
				<p>You get two committed house cleaners devoted to the deep cleaning and organization of your home. Strategy and management systems are put in place to maintain the healthiest of living environments.</p>

				<h2>About Joy</h2>
				<p>After 30 years in housekeeping services and a lot of frustration about the way things work I decided to take matters into my own hands and founded Joyfully Clean, a high-end housekeeping startup that prioritizes a tailored experience. With a trusted team of dedicated professionals by my side our mission is to deliver more than just cleaning—we bring peace of mind, consistency, and a personal touch to every home. At Joyfully Clean, we believe your space should reflect your lifestyle, and our goal is to ensure your house not only gets clean but stays beautifully maintained.</p>

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<details>
					<summary>Do I need to provide my own cleaning supplies and equipment?</summary>

					<summary>Do I need to be home for my booking?</summary>
					<p>Depending on the cleaning service you hired you may have to. Some cleaning services require someone to be home to provide access to certain areas of the house. However if you feel comfortable giving a spare key to the cleaning service, they can clean the house while you're not at home.</p>
